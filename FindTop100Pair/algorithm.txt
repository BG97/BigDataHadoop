mapper:
1.seperate the words, set the keys as text format so it can print it to hadoop.
2.make a string builder and output the keys vals pair
word 1
word2 1
word 1

Reducer:
frist: count how many value for a key(conbine)
second: if the string match the pattern i created in mapper after split, sum up all the keys, and the using hashmap to output the (key,sum) pair format.
else sum up all the key and then get the total sum of the key from hashmap hp; using these two value can get the relative number of certain key.
Any keys score equal to 1 will be eliminate it. ANd get top 100 score of the pair list.(reduce)
